# Detailing

## Getting started

1. Look for file run.bat and double click to open it
2. This will generate a dxf file that will be put in `generated` folder. See `read_me.pdf` file inside `generated` folder

## Editing input

1. Open `input` folder and look for `read_me.pdf` for further instructions on how to input data
2. Create columns, sections then beams using the sections and columns.

## Assumptions

1. You can't have a beam section with both top and bottom flange
2. In some instances, `beam depth` and `section depth` may mean the same thing. _**Ignore this comment for now**_
